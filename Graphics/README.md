# Graphics

This is just a collection of graphics, materials, and logos I've made in the past that might be interesting to look at.

These files are materials I've made for events and just for fun during my time spent at Johnson & Johnson.

### asklogo

This is a logo I worked for our app Ask. I tried to integrate a ? into the design because of the basis of the app relying on people to request items.

### burtday7
This is part of a series where I made a crossword for my friends birthday.

### cpp flyer, cppqcard
These are promotional materials I made for a school club.

### skinsightlogo
This is a logo I made for hackPrinceton 2018. The app we worked on was a mobile tool to aid in diagnosing skin diseases. The interesting part is more in the name because of the wordplay with "skin" and "insight" and "sight". I chose the color based on studies that have shown blue is a calming color. Since we were making a health-focused app, I wanted to use blue to give users a sense of peace while they were dealing with health issues.

Let me know if you have any questions!
