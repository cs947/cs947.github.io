### Furniture Design book cover
This project aimed to encapsulate the style of a furniture architect and express that in a book cover design.
Furniture designer: Frank Gehry
Movement: post-modernism
Quote: "You have to break it down into technical components, which are sort of mosaic in nature" from [here](http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/frank-gehry-filmmaker-interview/612/).

Frank Gehry is predominantly known for his whimsical and parametric architectural designs but I found out that his furniture was also very playful while also utilitarian.
His furniture designs all had common threads of
- organic curves
- inspired by the design of natural beings
- traditional materials used in new ways

Using these guiding principles I gathered from his furniture designs, I thought that this quote from an interview really characterized his work in furniture: "You have to break it down into technical components, which are sort of mosaic in nature" from [here](http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/frank-gehry-filmmaker-interview/612/).
