This file contains a data visualization that I created as a part of a group project. It can only be viewed with a server connection so I have saved a static version as staticcarolynspart.pdf. 


My part is in carolynspart.html.
The final group project is finalproject.html.
scrubedited.csv contains the data used after cleaning from the original source.
