## VirtualC

VirtualC aims to create opportunities for university professors to find the right collaborator for them.

### Problem
Professors are conducting more and more interdisciplinary research. There are far more potential people professors can work with as a result of industrialization and globalization. Professors can easily screen by skills without taking personality and work style into account leading to problems down the line in the partnerships. How can professors find the **right** collaborator?


### Solution
We decided to leverage modern technology to create a new way to allow professors to meet, get to know, and decide if they want to do research with someone else. VirtualC is a VR activity implemented at conferences across the world that facilitates meaningful discussion.
