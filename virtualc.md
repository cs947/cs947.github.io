# VirtualC

VirtualC aims to create opportunities for university professors to find the right collaborator for them.

### Problem
Professors are conducting more interdisciplinary research. There are far more potential people professors can work with as a result of industrialization and globalization. Professors can easily screen by skills without taking personality and work style into account leading to problems down the line in the partnerships. How can professors find the **right** collaborator?

### Solution
We decided to leverage modern technology to create a new way to allow professors to meet, get to know, and decide if they want to do research with someone else. VirtualC is a VR activity implemented at conferences across the world that facilitates meaningful discussion. Participants can choose a location to explore with their partner(s), allowing for common ground. Text prompts will appear every five minutes to initiate constructive discourse.

### Companion App Prototype

A companion app is used to help search for people to meet with and schedule meetings. People can search other registered attendees by name, interests, or availability. If professors would like to meet someone random, they only need to sign up for a time slot. Professors can meet either one-on-one or in groups of up to five. Time slots are 30 minutes, allowing for 20 minutes of meeting and five minutes of set-up and clean-up each.
